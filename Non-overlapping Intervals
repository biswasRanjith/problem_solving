Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], 
return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.


/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number}

var eraseOverlapIntervals = function(intervals) {
    let removalIntervals = 0;
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    let pre = intervals[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (pre[1] > intervals[i][0]) {
            removalIntervals++;
        }
        else pre = intervals[i];
    }
    return removalIntervals
};
