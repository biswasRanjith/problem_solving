You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"


/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {character}
 */
var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
    let result = 0; 
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        result ^= s.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
        result ^= t.charCodeAt(i);
    }
    return String.fromCharCode(result); 
};
